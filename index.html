    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Cookie Policy explains how <strong>Maina – The Voice of Care</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”)
      uses cookies and similar technologies (such as SDK identifiers, pixels, local storage, and beacons) in
      connection with our mobile application and related web pages (the “Services”).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Current Status (No Cookies Right Now)</h2>
    <p>
      As of the date above, we do <strong>not</strong> use cookies or similar tracking technologies in our app or website.
      However, we may introduce cookies or similar technologies in the future to improve functionality and user experience.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Future Use of Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      If we introduce cookies later, we may use them for the following purposes:

      <li><strong>Strictly Necessary:</strong> Enable core features such as security, authentication, and app stability (including crash and diagnostics).</li>
      <li><strong>Performance &amp; Analytics:</strong> Understand usage patterns, measure performance, and improve our Services (e.g., analytics and crash reporting).</li>
      <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Remember your settings and preferences (such as language or notification options).</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising &amp; Targeting (potential future use):</strong> If added later, show relevant ads or measure marketing effectiveness.</li>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      In the future, some features may be provided by third parties (for example, analytics, SDKs, or advertising providers).
      These third parties may set their own cookies or use identifiers within the app.
      We do not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of the respective providers.
